explore website:

1. scrapy shell "url link"

use spider:

1. scrap crawl spider_name -o output.json

Current scraping capabilities:

1. Bitcointalk forum: pass in a link to some thread, and the spider will scrape all of the posts in that thread. Then, it will
hop to the next thread and keep going until it hits the first thread in the form.

2. Altcointalk forums: pass in the forum link itself. It will go through all pages in that forum looking for threads.
Once finding a thread, it will scrape all the content in each thread and keep going to the next thread.

3. Coinmarketcap: Pick your range of dates and it will scrape all the coin values in that date range.

All code was developed by myself. The code may not be the most efficient, but it works. Currently, it has a built-in
delay of 1 second before opening a new thread, so as not to get blacklisted.
